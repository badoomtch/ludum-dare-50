# ludum-dare-50
This is my entry for the 50th Ludum Dare game jam.

Ice-olation is short survival game where you must try to live until you are rescued from your broken ice shelf. Catch & eat fish, chop wood and stay warm to survive.

Controls:
Move - WASD
Interact - Left Mouse Button
Pause - Escape/P for WebGL version
Jump - Space
Fishing - F

There are settings for Sensitivity, FOV and volume in the pause menu.

NOTES:
The Mac and Linux build are untested.

This was my 3rd Ludum Dare, I enjoyed this one a lot.
